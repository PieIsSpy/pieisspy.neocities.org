                <p>
                    Hello! Welcome to my website! Right now I'm not sure 
                    what would be the focus of my personal website, 
                    but currently my lineup is:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Coding</li>
                    <li>Games</li>
                    <li>General stuffs thats not supposed to be in a 
                        portfolio</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I made this website because I kept seeing videos about
                    the Indie Web, so those videos piqued my interest in it. I also made this
                    to advance study doing website development so that
                    I'll be able to focus more on my other subjects
                    (win-win!). Currently the website as it is is very
                    unfinished (literally every other page here doesn't
                    have css styling in it) since I'm doing it concurrently
                    as I progress through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>, 
                    so please have patience. Thanks for visiting!
