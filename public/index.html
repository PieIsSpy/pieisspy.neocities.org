                    <p>
                        Hello! Welcome to my website! Right now I'm not sure 
                        what would be the focus of my personal website, 
                        but currently my lineup is:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Coding</li>
                        <li>Games</li>
                        <li>General stuffs thats not supposed to be in a 
                            portfolio</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I made this website because I kept seeing videos about
                        the Indie Web, so those videos piqued my interest in it. I also made this
                        to advance study doing website development so that
                        I'll be able to focus more on my other subjects
                        (win-win!). Currently the website as it is is very
                        unfinished since I'm doing it concurrently
                        as I progress through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>, 
                        so please have patience. Thanks for visiting!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Version 1.0 is now up!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! As of 12/20/2025, this site is now in Version 1.0, where all
                        pages in here should be functional and viewable as intended! The reason
                        why I held back from copy pasting the template of the homepage to the other
                        pages is because I wanted to make its content and the links it goes to
                        to be easily consistent. However, users that have javascript disabled
                        might see a bit of an unpleasant sight since my implementation of the
                        template heavily depends on it, but thats another problem to conquer for another day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Obviously, the first two blogs are mainly for testing purposes (these are actually from
                        my course assignments lmao), my first real <span><a href="/public/blogs/blog3.html">blog</a></span>
                        is actually now up at the same time
                        as this version's release which discusses how I implemented the templating system
                        through javascript. (im also not sure if this segment should also be counted as a blog
                        but whatever, this is more of an update part)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here's some roadmap on what you can expect for the next versions, I'll be focusing on
                        functionality first before the design.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
