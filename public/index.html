                    hello. welcome to site. i dont know what to write, so i'll list down things that i want to eventually write or base the general theme around it.
                    terraria, minecraft, pokemon, coding, genshin, idk others i guess
                    i made this website because i keep seeing videos about it, so now i want to make one even though i dont know what to put in it.
                    i also made this website mainly because of pretty much all the slop pushed around social media. and it looks boring, so i want to try and design my website even if it would look bad. to be better at something, you have to do it.
                    the portfolio website in the github serves as a front, so you'd expect boring corporate stuff there, while this is primarily hosted in neocities. however this will also have a mirror in my github for version control. so while the contents here are personal, expect it to be pg-13 since it can be easily accessed in github.
                    i'll write more as this page evolves.
