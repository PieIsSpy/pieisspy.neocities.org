                    <p>
                        Hello! Welcome to my website! Right now I'm not sure 
                        what would be the focus of my personal website, 
                        but currently my lineup is:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Coding</li>
                        <li>Games</li>
                        <li>General stuffs thats not supposed to be in a 
                            portfolio</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I made this website because I kept seeing videos about
                        the Indie Web, so those videos piqued my interest in it. I also made this
                        to advance study doing website development so that
                        I'll be able to focus more on my other subjects
                        (win-win!). Currently the website as it is is very
                        unfinished since I'm doing it concurrently
                        as I progress through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>, 
                        so please have patience. Thanks for visiting!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                    <p>
                        Happy new year everyone! Hope everyone have had a great holiday!
                        As you may remember, I've had a roadmap of this website's future features.
                        However, cacheing generally just threw a wrench at my plans, so I'm moving towards
                        using SSG (specifically 11ty). I guess this also means users who've disabled
                        javascript is guaranteed to see the entire site except for specific parts of a
                        page that uses one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With this in mind, I don't really have any incentive to follow through with
                        the roadmap in v1. All of those will be integrated during the development of v2.
                        I guess this is for the best, so I can actually focus more on creating content
                        in my site rather than fight my way through the syntaxes and such.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I do have something currently cooking though, and while I'm excited (and impatient)
                        to write about it, it does have to cook a little bit more in-game, so here a screenshot instead:
