    <h2>DOM Manipulation and Website Templating</h2>
    <h3>12/20/2025</h3>

    <p>
        During the earlier days of my website, only the homepage was designed while the rest were seemingly left for dead. 
        Every page is now designed as of v1.0, but if you look at its html file, there's nothing in some of the parts. 
        How? This is one of the magic of using JavaScript through DOM manipulation.

    <h3 id="dom">Document Object Model</h3>
    <p>
        Document Object Model (or DOM for short) is a programming interface for documents.
        Its how the document is represented so programs can change its structure, style and content.
        It is constructed as a tree of Objects depending on how you placed your elements.
        Consider the following code block:
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code1.html" %}

    <p>
        If we were to represent this as a DOM tree, it would look more or less something like this:
    </p>

    <img class="img-content" src="/assets/blog3/dom1.png">

    <p>
        This is a simplified version of a DOM tree. In reality, the elements in this tree would have attributes attached to it, 
        like this (tree generated by this 
        <span><a href="https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a></span>):
    </p>

    <img class="img-content" src="/assets/blog3/dom2.png">

    <p>
        As you can see, the DOM tree also stores the element's attributes and its child text content. 
        You can also notice that there are a lot of empty text children in it. 
        DOM also stores the whitespaces of the html file, which is why we fix formatting issues in 
        HTML through CSS or manually remove the said format in the HTML file itself. 
        For this blog, this is a topic out of our scope.

    <h3 id="methods">Common DOM Manipulation Methods in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        These are the methods that we will be using for this tutorial:
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code2.html" %}

    <p>
        Of course, since a DOM is an object, it contains more methods and attributes 
        than just these methods listed here. You can find the full list

    <h3 id="implementation">Implementation of Templating</h3>

    <p>
        In order to do our implementation (or at least that's how I did it), 
        its important to already have a template in mind. My suggestion for this is to hard code 
        the template that you want to use and style it early on, then implement it to the other pages 
        so that the only thing you have to do is to import both CSS and JS files into your HTML file for 
        the template to load (for example, template first the home page, then implement it for the rest of the pages).
    </p>

    <p>
        Going back to our code block, we already have a header and a footer that we want to 
        reuse to the other pages (I'm keeping this simple for the new ones reading here). 
        Copy the contents of the header and footer into a safe place for reference, then delete those. 
        You should have something like this:
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code3.html" %}

    <p>
        Then, we will edit the attributes and text content of the header and footer in the JavaScript file. 
        Lets start with the header. The only thing we need to do here to replicate the original is to first 
        query the header from the HTML DOM and set its textContent to "Title".
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code4.html" %}

    <p>
        If we also want to turn it into a link to the home page (assume our home page to be index.html), 
        then we'd need to add an anchor <code class="inline-code">&lt;a&gt;</code> 
        tag to store the text content, then append it into the header.
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code5.html" %}

    <p>
        We'll be doing the same exact thing for the footer, but this time we want the link to be opened in a 
        new tab and have the rel set to "noopener noreferrer" (since this is an external site, we're preventing 
        tabnabbing and https referrer for privacy).
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code6.html" %}

    <p>
        And that's it! All you need to do now is to call both of these functions in your main function 
        in the JS file and link both it and your CSS (assuming you've already styled the template before 
        as said earlier) files into your <code class="inline-code">&lt;head&gt;</code> and all things should be running.
    </p>
    {% include "partials/blog3/code7.html" %}

    <p>
        This is just one of the most basic example of DOM Manipulation. If you want to implement a navbar section for all
        your pages, you can list all your (title page, link) pairs into an array, then for each pair, the script will 
        create a new anchor <code class="inline-code">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag that has its textContent set to the page, and its href set to the link of the said page 
        and appends it into the navbar div you've already defined in the HTML file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, this goes without saying, but the script won't work for users who disabled JS, so only the main 
        content will appear on them. An alternative for this is a static site generator (SSG), which generates an html 
        based on the content and its given templates. Using this can make your html files smaller and, in turn, faster to load
        and can even help you in cachebusting old css and js files in the server your website is being hosted on. If you'd
        like to try that method out, I highly recommend petrapixel's
